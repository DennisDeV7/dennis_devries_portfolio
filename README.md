# Personal Portfolio

This is my software development portfolio from my education at Code Fellows.

## Build

I built this site using Vite, Three.js, and plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Coming Soon

I am working on the 3d objects using Blender to add to the landing page in order to experiment with Three.js which creates 3d environments on the web.

## Run

With npm installed on your local machine. Install dependencies with:

```txt
npm install
```

Start local server with:

```txt
npm run dev
```
